		His philosophy of practice is simple.
		The patient comes first!
		Each patient needs to be assessed individually, and his or her specific needs must be addressed.
		The goal is to do everything to make sure that the patient has the best possible experience before, during and after surgery.
		This includes working closely at all times with the surgeons to keep our patients comfortable and safe.
		</p>
		<p>
		For many patients, anesthesia is a big scary unknown, and the anesthesiologist is there to develop a positive, reassuring relationship,
		and then use the best medical techniques to give a great anesthetic.
		This way, the patient can focus on a speedy comfortable recovery,
		</p>

		Outside of work, Dr. Einstein is the proud father of two college students and a graduate student.
		He is a self-described swimming fanatic, who works out every morning, even on weekends, with the local masters swimming club.
		Dr. Einstein was born in Switzerland, and is fluent in German, Spanish, French and English.
		Professionally, he is very pleased that he was included in Woodward and White's list of best Doctors in America.
